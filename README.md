Project Description:

Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a versatile tool for information gathering and data encryption/decryption. The tool will have a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) implemented in Python.

Features:

Information Gathering:

Stealth Scan: The tool will incorporate stealth scanning capabilities, allowing users to perform discreet network reconnaissance. This can be achieved through the utilization of tools like Nmap, with a focus on advanced techniques.
Metagoofil Integration: The tool will seamlessly integrate with Metagoofil for metadata extraction from various file types. This will enhance the information gathering process, providing valuable insights into the target.
Cipher Functionality:

The GUI will support the following encryption and decryption methods:
Caesar Cipher: Users can input text and choose to encrypt or decrypt using the Caesar Cipher.
Playfair Cipher: This cipher will be available for both encryption and decryption operations.
Monoalphabetic Cipher: Users can encrypt and decrypt text using the Monoalphabetic Cipher.
Encryption and Decryption:

Users will be able to input text via the GUI and select the desired cipher for encryption. The tool will provide encrypted output using the chosen cipher method.
Similarly, users can input encrypted text and select the corresponding decryption option. The tool will decrypt the text using the specified cipher.
Cipher Variety:

The tool will offer a range of cipher options to provide flexibility and cater to different encryption needs.
Security:

To enhance security, the tool will implement encryption for sensitive information. Users can utilize the GUI to encrypt and decrypt data using a variety of ciphers, securing their communications.
Implementation:
The entire project will be implemented using the Python programming language, leveraging its extensive libraries and support for GUI development. The GUI toolkit (e.g., Tkinter) will be employed to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Encryption and decryption functions for each cipher will be implemented in Python, ensuring efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion:
This project aims to deliver a comprehensive tool that combines information gathering capabilities with versatile encryption/decryption functionalities. It will provide users with a seamless experience for securing their data and conducting network reconnaissance.
